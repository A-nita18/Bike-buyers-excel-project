# Excel Bike Buyers Dashboard

This project analyzes the **Bike Buyers dataset** using Microsoft Excel.  
It explores which customer demographics are most likely to purchase a bike, based on income, commute distance, age, education, and region.

##  Project Overview
The dataset includes customer information such as:
- **Marital Status, Gender, and Age**
- **Income and Education Level**
- **Occupation and Home Ownership**
- **Commute Distance and Region**
- **Whether the customer purchased a bike**

Using Excel, I performed:
- **Data Cleaning:** Removed duplicates, standardized categories, and handled missing values  
- **Data Analysis:** Created pivot tables to summarize trends across demographics  
- **Visualization:** Built an interactive dashboard showing:
  - Average income of bike buyers vs. non-buyers  
  - Bike purchase trends by age and gender  
  - Regional comparison of bike buyers  
  - Commute distance influence on bike purchases

- Middle-aged professionals show the highest purchase rates  
- Certain regions (like Europe) had more consistent bike buying patterns
